Compiling
--------------------
Make sure that Erlang is in your path and that it is compiled with wx.

Then just type `make`, this will create a file called `geprof` in the 
root directory which is all you need to run geprof.

Running

Use the escript created when compiling to start geprof. It can be started 
with or without arguments. For a list of available arguments type 
`geprof --help`
